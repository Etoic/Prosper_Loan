# (Prosper Loan Data)
## by (Tolulope Ogunfuwa)


## Dataset

> The working dataset contains 83982 loans with 21 features was sieved out from 113937 loans and 81 features. 

> To arrive at the working dataset, multiple data wrangling and cleaning processes were carried. These processes included: dropping columns that had more than 50% of missing values, changing datatypes of columns, extracting months and years from a date column, renaming the observations of a column, etc. 


## Summary of Findings

> The distribution for the Year indicates that most of the loans were collected in 2013. I don't have enough information to give a suggestion to why 2013 experienced an overwhelming number of loan collection.

> The distribution for the Month shows that January, October, & December are the three most active months for loan collection. These months are either toward the end of a year or the beginning of a new year. It can be suggested that people like to borrow loans in those periods to prepare for the festive season as well as prepare for what the new year holds in terms of personal projects, school fees, & other expenses.

> The distribution indicates that it is multimodal. Across the distribution, we see about four different peak periods. One is between 0.08 & 0.09. The 2nd is between 0.2 & 0.22. The third is between 0.28 & 0.29. And the last one, with the most counts, is between 0.34 & 0.36. The distribution mainly spans between 0.1 & 0.4

> The distribution for the Borrower's Rate is almost identical to that of Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR). They share the similar pattern of having multiple modes within the same range.


> The distribution done showed that the Debt to Income ratio is skewed to the right and it's between 0 & 1. It also has peak that's between 0.25 & 0.29. It indicates that most borrowers prefer a ratio between 0.25 & 0.29.

> In the distribution done, we observed multiple modes for the Loan Original Amount. The most loan amount is between 4,000 & 6,000. The multiple mode situation suggests that people like to borrow in the multiples of 5,000

> From the pie chart created, we observed that almost 80% of borrowers are employed which suggests that being employed is significant to getting a loan.

> From the pie chart created, we observed that most of the people fall within ratings E to A. The remaining percentages are either people with the lowest credit risk (AA) or the highest credit risk (HR)

> From the bar chart created, most people borrow because they want to consolidate debts. Borrowing more to consolidate debts doesn't sound healthy.

> From the bar chart created, most people did not state their occupation. 2nd to that group of people are those who are professionals.

> From the heatmap and the gridplot, we observed that only a few variables are strongly correlated. Examples of varibles with good correlation are Borrower APR & Borrower Rate, Loan Original Amount & Monthly Loan Payment.

> From the boxplot created, we observed a linear relationship between the Borrower APR & the Prosper Ratings. The lower the Borrower's APR, the better the Prosper Ratings.

> From the boxplot created, we observed a linear relationship between the Original Loan Amount and the tenure of the loan. The longer the term, the higher the amount borrowed.

> From the boxplot created, we observed a significant correlation between the Original Loan Amount & the employee status. The employed people enjoy more original amout. It further solidifies the earlier assertion that the employee status is a key criteria to loan disbursement.

> From the column bar charts created, we observed that most people like to take loans of 3 years and above. Also, those under the "HR" rating only took three years term loans.

> After further analysis, we observed that with better Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms increases, the increase amplitude of loan amount between terms also becomes larger.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> January, October, December, November, & February are the five most active months for loan collection. These months are either toward the end of a year or the beginning of a new year. It can be suggested that people like to borrow loans in those periods to prepare for the festive season as well as prepare for what the new year holds in terms of personal projects, school fees, & other expenses.
